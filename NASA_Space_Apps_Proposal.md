## Executive Summary (300 Words Max)

We have selected the **"A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI"** challenge to address one of the most pressing bottlenecks in modern astronomical research: the efficient analysis of vast exoplanetary datasets from multiple NASA space missions. This challenge represents a critical intersection of big data analytics, machine learning innovation, and scientific discovery that could fundamentally transform how we identify and study worlds beyond our solar system.

The exponential growth of space-based survey data has created an unprecedented opportunity to discover new exoplanets, yet current manual analysis methods cannot keep pace with the volume of data being generated. Thousands of potential planetary signals remain buried in archives from Kepler, K2, and TESS missions, representing untapped scientific potential that could reveal habitable worlds or exotic planetary systems. The challenge seeks solutions that can automatically process this wealth of information while maintaining the scientific rigor required for astronomical research.

Our proposed approach focuses on developing a unified artificial intelligence framework capable of analyzing data across multiple NASA missions, each with distinct characteristics and classification schemes. The solution will incorporate advanced machine learning methodologies, including ensemble techniques and hierarchical classification strategies, to handle the diverse nature of exoplanetary data. By creating an intelligent system that can adapt to different mission specifications while maintaining consistent performance standards, we aim to unlock the full potential of NASA's exoplanet survey archives.

The ultimate goal extends beyond mere automationâ€”we envision a transformative tool that democratizes access to advanced exoplanet analysis capabilities through an intuitive web interface. This platform will enable researchers worldwide, from major institutions to citizen scientists, to contribute to exoplanet discovery efforts. Our solution directly addresses the challenge's core objectives by providing automated classification capabilities, supporting multiple data formats, and maintaining the transparency essential for scientific validation and peer review processes.

## Problem Definition (150 words)

The exponential growth of exoplanetary data from NASA's space-based missions (Kepler, K2, TESS) has created a significant bottleneck in astronomical research. Currently, most exoplanet identification relies on manual analysis by astrophysicists, creating delays in discovery pipelines and limiting the full utilization of available datasets containing over 20,000 planetary candidates and confirmed exoplanets.

This manual approach faces three critical challenges: (1) **Scale limitation** - human analysts cannot efficiently process the massive volumes of transit photometry data being generated, (2) **Consistency issues** - manual classification introduces subjective variations and potential human error, and (3) **Resource constraints** - time-intensive analysis limits comprehensive dataset reviews.

The significance extends beyond operational efficiency. With TESS continuing to generate new data and future missions planned, the gap between data collection and analysis will widen without automated solutions. This challenge directly impacts exoplanetary discovery pace and our ability to identify potentially habitable worlds, representing a fundamental bottleneck in astronomy's most exciting frontier.

## Background & Literature Review (200 Words Max)

Recent advances in automated exoplanet classification have demonstrated promising results across multiple approaches. Pearson et al. (2018) in "Searching for Exoplanets Using Artificial Intelligence" achieved significant accuracy improvements using convolutional neural networks on Kepler light curves, establishing deep learning as a viable approach for transit signal detection. Their work demonstrated that AI models could identify planet candidates missed by traditional algorithms, suggesting untapped potential in existing datasets.

Complementary research by Zink et al. (2020) focused on ensemble methods for exoplanet validation, showing that combining multiple machine learning approaches significantly improves classification reliability compared to single-model solutions. This work highlighted the importance of feature engineering and cross-validation strategies in astronomical applications where false positives carry significant scientific consequences.

Current automated solutions primarily focus on single-mission datasets, with limited cross-mission compatibility. Most existing approaches emphasize light curve analysis rather than leveraging rich tabular data available in NASA's catalogs. Recent studies show traditional machine learning models can achieve high accuracy on tabular exoplanet features, but systematic comparison across missions remains limited.

The literature reveals a gap in unified approaches that can handle diverse classification schemes across NASA missions while maintaining scientific rigor and interpretable results for research applications.

## Methodology

Our methodology adopts a comprehensive multi-phase approach that systematically addresses the challenge's requirements while maintaining scientific rigor throughout the development process.

**Data Integration and Preprocessing Foundation**
The initial phase focuses on establishing robust data pipelines capable of handling the diverse characteristics of NASA's exoplanet datasets. We will implement standardized preprocessing workflows that accommodate the unique specifications of each mission while ensuring consistent data quality and format compatibility. This involves developing automated cleaning procedures for missing value imputation, outlier detection, and feature normalization that preserve the astronomical significance of the original measurements. The preprocessing framework will be designed with modularity in mind, allowing for mission-specific adaptations while maintaining a unified underlying structure.

**Advanced Classification Framework Development**  
Our machine learning approach centers on developing ensemble-based classification systems that can effectively handle the varying complexity of different mission datasets. We will implement and compare multiple algorithmic approaches, including gradient boosting methods, random forest ensembles, and support vector machines, to identify optimal performance characteristics for each dataset type. The framework will incorporate cross-validation strategies specifically designed for astronomical data, accounting for temporal dependencies and class imbalance issues common in exoplanet catalogs.

**Hierarchical Classification Integration**
For datasets with complex multi-class structures, particularly the TESS Objects of Interest with its five-category classification scheme (confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, false positives, ambiguous planetary candidates, and known planets), we will explore hierarchical classification methodologies. This approach involves structuring the classification problem as a tree-like decision process, where initial classifications separate broad categories before making fine-grained distinctions. This strategy can potentially improve accuracy by leveraging the natural relationships between different object types and reducing the complexity of individual classification decisions.

**Interactive Platform Development**
The final methodological component involves creating a user-centered web interface that bridges the gap between advanced machine learning capabilities and practical astronomical research needs. This platform will provide intuitive data upload mechanisms, real-time classification processing, and comprehensive visualization tools that allow researchers to explore results and understand model decision-making processes. The interface design will prioritize accessibility for users with varying levels of technical expertise while maintaining the detailed analytical capabilities required for professional astronomical research.
