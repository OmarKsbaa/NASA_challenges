## Exoplanet Classification Project — README

This README explains how to use the Kepler-derived cumulative exoplanet dataset (the CSV in this folder) to build an AI/ML pipeline that classifies each row as a confirmed exoplanet, candidate, or false positive. It includes a detailed column overview (typical Kepler cumulative catalog fields), data-preprocessing instructions, suggested feature engineering, model choices, training & evaluation guidance, and a recommended minimal web UI design for uploading new data and running inference.

Note: I inspected `cumulative_2025.09.25_10.52.58.csv` and updated this README to use the exact column names present in the file. The CSV is a Kepler Exoplanet Archive cumulative table and includes the following key columns (exact names appear in the CSV header):

Exact relevant columns in this CSV (canonical mapping):
- `kepid` (KepID) — unique Kepler identifier (tracking only).
- `kepoi_name` (KOI Name) / `kepler_name` (Kepler Name) — object names (tracking only).
- `koi_disposition` (Exoplanet Archive Disposition) — a catalog disposition string (often CONFIRMED/CANDIDATE/FALSE POSITIVE from archiving process).
- `koi_pdisposition` (Disposition Using Kepler Data) — the label suggested for supervised learning. Values seen include: `CONFIRMED`, `CANDIDATE`, `FALSE POSITIVE`.
- `koi_score` (Disposition Score) — numeric vetting score; useful as a feature.
- False-positive flags: `koi_fpflag_nt` (Not Transit-Like), `koi_fpflag_ss` (Stellar Eclipse), `koi_fpflag_co` (Centroid Offset), `koi_fpflag_ec` (Ephemeris Match). These are binary flags (0/1) indicating common false-positive reasons.
- Transit summary metrics (key predictive features):
   - `koi_period` (Orbital Period [days])
   - `koi_time0bk` (Transit Epoch [BKJD])
   - `koi_impact` (Impact Parameter)
   - `koi_duration` (Transit Duration [hrs])
   - `koi_depth` (Transit Depth [ppm])
   - `koi_model_snr` (Transit Signal-to-Noise)

- Planet properties:
   - `koi_prad` (Planetary Radius [Earth radii])

- Environment / host-star properties:
   - `koi_teq` (Equilibrium Temperature [K])
   - `koi_insol` (Insolation Flux [Earth flux])
   - `koi_steff` (Stellar Effective Temperature [K])
   - `koi_slogg` (Stellar Surface Gravity [log10(cm/s**2)])
   - `koi_srad` (Stellar Radius [Solar radii])
   - `koi_kepmag` (Kepler-band magnitude)

- Misc and provenance:
   - `koi_tce_plnt_num`, `koi_tce_delivname` (TCE identifiers and delivery names)
   - `ra`, `dec` (coordinates)

I used those exact names and suggested mapping throughout the README’s preprocessing and modeling sections. If you want, I can make the README show a column -> recommended feature action table (keep/drop/impute/transform) and then implement `src/preprocess.py` that executes those mappings automatically.

## Short contract (inputs / outputs / success criteria)
- Input: CSV rows (one row per transit/object) with numeric and categorical astrophysical features and a label column `Disposition Using Kepler Data`.
- Output: A trained classifier that given a new row returns one of {CONFIRMED, CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE} and a probability/confidence score; plus a simple web UI for uploading data and visualizing results.
- Success criteria: Target high recall and precision for the CONFIRMED class. Practical metrics: PR-AUC >= 0.8 and per-class F1 >= 0.7 are good starting goals (dataset-dependent).

## Typical columns (what they mean and how to use them)
Below are commonly found columns in Kepler/K2 cumulative catalogs. If your CSV uses different names, find the equivalent column and map it before preprocessing.

- `kepid` / `kepoi_name` / `koi_name` — unique identifiers for each Kepler Object of Interest (string). Use for tracking only; do NOT use as model features.
- `Disposition Using Kepler Data` / `koi_disposition` — target label (string): typically one of `CONFIRMED`, `CANDIDATE`, `FALSE POSITIVE`. Convert to integer or one-hot for training.
- `koi_period` / `period` — orbital period (days, numeric). Often log-transform (log10(period)) helps.
- `koi_time0bk` / `t0` — time of transit center (BJD). Usually not predictive; ignore unless engineering phase-related features.
- `koi_duration` / `duration` — transit duration (hours or days). Numeric. Normalize or scale.
- `koi_depth` / `depth` — transit depth (ppm or relative flux). Strong predictive power — larger depths often indicate larger planets or eclipsing binaries.
- `koi_prad` / `planet_radius` — planetary radius in Earth radii. Numeric; missing for some candidates — impute carefully.
- `koi_ror` — planet-to-star radius ratio (Rp/Rs). Very informative; can be redundant with `prad` depending on presence of stellar radius.
- `koi_teq` — equilibrium temperature estimate (K). Numeric; may be noisy but useful.
- `koi_insol` — incident flux relative to Earth (S/S_earth). Numeric.
- `koi_srad` / `st_rad` / `stellar_radius` — host star radius (solar radii). Important when converting r/Rs to absolute radius.
- `koi_steff` / `st_teff` — stellar effective temperature (K). Numeric, used as stellar context.
- `koi_slogg` / `st_logg` — stellar surface gravity. Numeric.
- `koi_smet` / `st_met` — stellar metallicity (if present). Categorical/numeric.
- `koi_kepmag` / `kepmag` — Kepler magnitude (stellar brightness). Numeric; brightness relates to SNR of transit.
- `koi_depth_err` / `koi_period_err` etc. — measurement uncertainties. Can be used directly or to weight samples.
- `koi_score` — some catalogs include a vetting score between 0..1. Use as feature if present.

If your dataset includes light curve snippets (time-series flux data) instead of only summary metrics, see the "If you have light curves" section below.

## Common data issues and preprocessing steps
1. Sanity check & column mapping
   - Inspect column names and types. Map columns with different names to canonical names used in preprocessing.

2. Remove duplicates and impossible values
   - Drop duplicate `kepid` rows if they represent identical records (but preserve different KOIs if they are distinct events).
   - Remove rows with non-physical values (negative radii, negative durations, zero or negative flux uncertainties). Flag extreme outliers.

3. Handle missing data
   - If only a small portion of rows miss a feature, drop the rows.
   - For important features with moderate missingness (e.g., stellar radius), impute using domain-aware methods:
     - Numeric median or iterative imputer (sklearn's IterativeImputer) using related columns (e.g., infer planet radius from R_p/R_s and stellar radius).
     - Use flags: create boolean columns like `prad_missing` to preserve information about imputation.

4. Transformations
   - Log-transform skewed features (depth, period, radius, insolation): e.g., x -> log10(x + small_eps).
   - Scale numeric features with StandardScaler or RobustScaler (RobustScaler if many outliers).

5. Categorical encoding
   - Label-encode or one-hot encode any categorical features (host star spectral type, instrument channel, etc.).

6. Class labels
   - Map `Disposition Using Kepler Data` to integers: CONFIRMED=2, CANDIDATE=1, FALSE POSITIVE=0 (or use one-hot). Document mapping and keep consistent between training and inference.

7. Class imbalance
   - Typically CONFIRMED is the smallest class. Use:
     - Stratified K-fold cross-validation.
     - Class weighting in loss (e.g., scale_pos_weight for XGBoost) or `class_weight='balanced'` in sklearn models.
     - Oversampling minority class (SMOTE) or undersampling majority — careful to avoid overfitting.

## Feature engineering ideas
- Combine `koi_depth` and `koi_duration` into an SNR-like quantity: depth / duration.
- Use Rp/Rs and stellar radius to recompute planetary radius if missing: Rp = (Rp/Rs) * Rs.
- Compute transit shape metrics (if transit time-series available): V-shape vs U-shape detection features (can discriminate eclipsing binaries).
- Create SNR estimate from depth and magnitude (brighter stars -> higher SNR).
- Binning period into categories (ultra-short, short, long) may help tree models.

## Model choices & engineering
1. Tabular classifiers (start here)
   - XGBoost or LightGBM: strong baseline for tabular astrophysical data.
   - RandomForest: robust baseline.
   - LogisticRegression: simple baseline for calibration and interpretability.
   - Neural networks (MLP): only after strong baselines; needs careful regularization.

2. If you have light curves (time-series)
   - 1D CNNs (e.g., ResNet-style conv nets over normalized folded light curves).
   - Recurrent networks (LSTM/GRU) for sequential modeling or transformers for more advanced setups.
   - Hybrid models: extract summary features from light curves (period, depth, durations) plus CNN embeddings.

3. Ensembling
   - Stack XGBoost + LightGBM + small NN for improved performance.

4. Hyperparameter tuning
   - Use randomized search / Optuna for efficient hyperparameter search.

## Evaluation strategy
- Use stratified train/validation/test splits (e.g., 60/20/20) or stratified K-fold CV (k=5).
- Key metrics:
  - Precision, recall, F1 per class.
  - Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC) especially when classes are imbalanced.
  - ROC-AUC (useful but can be misleading with heavy imbalance).
  - Confusion matrix and per-class support.
  - Calibration curve (for probability outputs).

Threshold tuning
- For operational use (flagging high-confidence candidates), tune decision thresholds to maximize recall at an acceptable precision level (e.g., recall >= 0.9 with precision >= 0.6 depending on mission needs).

Cross-validation tips
- Use time-aware splits if dataset evolves over time (e.g., newer KOIs may have different properties). Otherwise, stratified K-fold is fine.

## Explainability and diagnostics
- SHAP values: compute feature importance and per-sample explanations to understand what drives a classification.
- Partial dependence plots for most influential numeric features.
- Investigate false positives: often eclipsing binaries or instrumental artifacts — examine input features for these rows.

## Minimal pipeline & file layout suggestion
- data/
  - raw/ — original CSV(s)
  - processed/ — cleaned csv, train/test splits
- src/
  - preprocess.py — column mapping, cleaning, imputation, feature engineering
  - train.py — training script using sklearn/XGBoost
  - predict.py — inference script for new CSVs
  - explain.py — SHAP explanations
- models/
  - model_xgb.pkl
- web/
  - app_streamlit.py or app_flask.py

## Quick example: commands (PowerShell)
Below are example commands to run from this repository root. These assume you create the scripts listed above and a Python environment with dependencies.

```powershell
# Create virtual environment and install deps
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -U pip
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm shap streamlit matplotlib seaborn

# Preprocess the CSV and create processed train/test
python src\preprocess.py --input data\raw\cumulative_2025.09.25_10.52.58.csv --output data\processed\clean.csv

# Train model
python src\train.py --input data\processed\clean.csv --model-out models\model_xgb.pkl

# Run Streamlit demo
streamlit run web\app_streamlit.py
```

## Web UI design options
1. Streamlit (fast, minimal effort)
   - Pros: < 1 hour to build a usable UI that accepts CSV uploads, shows predictions and SHAP explanations.
   - Files: `web/app_streamlit.py` handles upload, calls `predict.py` and shows results.

2. Flask/FastAPI + simple React front-end
   - Pros: production-ready, friendlier for user management & async tasks.
   - Design: POST /predict to send CSV or JSON, returns predictions + probabilities. Separate /explain endpoint to fetch SHAP values.

3. Deployment
   - For demos use Streamlit on a VM or deploy to Streamlit Cloud.
   - For scalable service use Docker + FastAPI + Gunicorn/Uvicorn behind a small web server.

## If you have light curves (folded time-series)
- Preprocessing: detrend, normalize, fold by period, resample to fixed length, optionally augment (time shifts, noise injection).
- Model: 1D CNN over fixed-length folded light curve. Combine CNN embedding with tabular features in a late-fusion network.

## Edge cases & caveats
- Label noise: vetting labels (CONFIRMED vs CANDIDATE) change over time as follow-ups happen. If possible, use the latest vetted catalog and log catalog version.
- Instrumental systematics: sometimes false positives are caused by spacecraft artifacts — incorporate instrument/channel metadata if present.
- Covariate shift: K2 and TESS differ in observing strategy; models trained on Kepler may not transfer directly to TESS — consider domain adaptation or retraining on mission-specific data.

## Explainability & science validation
- Provide domain scientists with a validation report: most important features, representative false positives and false negatives, and visual checks (e.g., folded light curve overlays) to validate model behavior.

## Quality gates (recommended before release)
- Build: verify Python scripts run end-to-end on a small subset.
- Lint/typecheck: run flake8 / mypy if adding types.
- Unit tests: add smoke tests for `preprocess.py` and `predict.py` (e.g., small crafted CSV inputs, expected shape of outputs).

## Next steps I can help with
1. Implement `src/preprocess.py` and `src/train.py` with a working baseline (XGBoost) and small unit tests.
2. Build a Streamlit demo `web/app_streamlit.py` that loads a saved model and runs inference.
3. Run a quick baseline training on this CSV (requires me to open the CSV).

If you want me to continue: tell me which of the next steps to do first (1, 2, or 3). If you want me to inspect the CSV and tailor the README to exact column names, confirm and I'll open the file and update the document and pipelines accordingly.
